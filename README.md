# Project 6 (TP)
Taking project 5 to a whole new level... (Sockets, Minimax,...)

## Some Basic Developement Coexistence Rules.
* Every functional change in the project must be commited.
* Avoid extra large super commits.
* Be clear in the commit title.
* Silly commit descriptions are not allowed (except in the last commit).
* Generally specific tasks will be posted as issues, each issue should have its own branch.

## Design Notes.
The current project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to implement the esential part of the project.  
More specific notes about this will be updated as soon as possible.
